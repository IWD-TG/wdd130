        <p>Hello! I'm Gabriel & I am currently a cybersecurity major! I enjoy many different things from games (both board and video), to books, and many others. 
        I am hoping to get as much out of this as I can. It also turns out I have family that wants some help with a website or two!
        </p>
        <p>I am also a return missionary from the CA Fresno mission where most of my time was in the office for tech, Facebook, and media outreach.
